## pros & cons

### pros

* Great accessibility for keyboard input & screen readers
* Build in Typescript so expected props & methods are clear
* Easy to install & use (clear docs)
* You can change the element type using `as`
* Works fine in combination with custom elements
* Forces you to keep UI components clean and write logic around them instead of in them

### cons

* Requires Vue 3 (so older projects have to be migrated)
* Scope of the project is currently quite limited with missing features (eg: nested menu)
